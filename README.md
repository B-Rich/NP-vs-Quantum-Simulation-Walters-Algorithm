This repository contains code for simulating Zachery B Walter's [claimed Linear-time 3SAT algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00409) with Microsoft's LIQUID, as well as code for simulating the classical variant of the algorithm.

Based on the behavior of thesimulation, [I think the algorithm is actually exponential time](http://algorithmicassertions.com/post/1617).
